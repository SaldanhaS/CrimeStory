<h1> The Time </h1>
<div id = "onlytxt">
 <p> You could easily tell the Detective was a peculiar person by just looking at him.
 He had many obsessions, but the most noteworthy was his obsession with time. <br>
 Constantly keeping track of it, the Detective was never late for any occasion. 
 Naturally, the detective had a love for watches, especially electronic ones.<br> 
 He was fascinated by their accuracy and dependability. 
 He had a small collection of rare electronic watches on one of his shelves, <br>which he examined every evening before bed. 
 Interestingly, none of them were adjusted to show the correct time and nobody knew the reason except for the Detective himself.<br><br>

 <p>While going through his daily watch examination, the Detective noticed that there was something off with one of his watches.<br>
 He meticulously fixed it and then continued his evening routine.
 However, just when he went under the blankets and started drifting away,<br> his phone rang.
 He looked at the screen and read “Commissioner Morrow.”
 the Detective had to answer as he rarely received calls from the police department,<br> and never at night.<br>
“Good evening, Commissioner. Didn’t expect calls at this time, is there a problem?”<br>
“Hello, Detective. We have a case here and I think you may be interested.”<br>
“I’m listening…” he replied, yet couldn’t stop thinking about his watch.”</p>
